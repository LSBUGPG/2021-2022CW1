	MAKE AI OBJECTS FOLLOW THE PLAYER

1. Setup a scene with a terrain, a player object that can be controlled and at least one object that is going to follow the player.

2. Head to "Window" in the menu bar and navigate to "AI". Once there, click on "Navigation". This will create a new window adjacent to the inspector labelled "Navigation".

3. Once in the Navigation window, click on "Bake". This will create a surface that the AI can maneuver freely over.

4. Select the enemy AI objects and add a component to them. The component of choice is called a "Nav Mesh Agent". Here you can adjust the stopping distance of the AI, which will ensure that the AI does not pass a certain distance (in given units) within the radius of the player object.

5. Next, create a new C# script by right clicking in the assets folder and clicking "Create new C# Script"

6. In the script editor, start by declaring your variables. Write "public NavMeshAgent enemy;". This will refer to the "Nav Mesh Agent" component on our AI.

7. Create another variable by writing "public Transform Player;". This will refer to the player object's position. The player object is the object that you control via input.

8. Inside the "void Update" function, write "enemy.SetDestination(Player.position);". This tells the "enemy" object to set a course to the "Player" object's position over the surface of the Nav Mesh created in step 2.

9. Save the script and head back to unity. Drag the C# script onto each enemy that wil use the ability to follow the player.

10. Underneath the script, inside the inspector there are 2 spots for the script to accept the "Player" and "Enemy" spaces. Drag the player object into "Player" and the corresponding "Enemy" object into "Enemy".

When you play the game, all enemy objects should now follow the player.
