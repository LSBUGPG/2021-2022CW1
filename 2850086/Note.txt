Hello,

My component package has a few things, the main scripts being:
- first person look	- mouse
- movement (WASD) 	- with gravity
- FlashLight 		- Toggle with F
- Pressure Plate 	- Both the block and player can stand on this to activate something
- Block Pickup/Drop	- hold left mouse when looking at the block

Thanks

Oliver Mota
