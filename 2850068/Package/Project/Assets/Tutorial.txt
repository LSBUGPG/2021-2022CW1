1) Import the ‘Quest Items Package’ into your scene.
2) Create an empty game object called ‘QuestItemCounter’ and add the
‘QuestItemsCounter’ Script to it.
3) Next add the ‘Quest Item’ script to your quest items in the scene.
4) Then add a large sphere collider with trigger ticked to each of your quest items in the
scene. The Player will only be able to pick up this quest item if they are inside of the
trigger.
5) On your Quest Items drag the ‘Quest Items Counter’ Game Object into the slot on the
script. Make sure you do this for every quest item.
6) Next give each type of quest item a tag that corresponds to its type.
'questItem1' For the first type of items
'questItem2' For the second type of items
'questItem3' For the third type of items
'questItem4' For the fourth type of items
7) Ensure that your player has the tag: “Player” and that they have a rigid body
component.
Now when the player enters the sphere collider of one of the quest items and
presses the E key, they pick up the item.
