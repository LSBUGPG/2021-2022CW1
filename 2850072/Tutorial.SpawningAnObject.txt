How to spawn an object in Unity using the instantiate function:
1. Create a scene. 
2. Create a spawning object prefab.
3. Create an empty game object and name it to "SpawnPoint". This will be the spawner of the object you want to instantiate. 
4. Add a trigger object (it has to have a collider), tick "Is Trigger", so when you move through the trigger object, an object is instantiated.
5. Make the "SpawnPoint" GameObject a child of the Trigger object.
6. Add this script to the trigger object:
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class SpawnTrigger : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform SpawnPoint;
    public Rigidbody Prefab;
    
    
    private void OnTriggerEnter ()
    {
        Rigidbody RigidPrefab;
        RigidPrefab = Instantiate(Prefab, SpawnPoint.position, SpawnPoint.rotation) as Rigidbody; 
    }
}
Explanation of the code: It has the public spawn point and a prefab that has a rigid body, so when the object is instantiated it falls down to the ground.
The instantiate function of the code is to instantiate the prefab you asign to the public rigidbody.
7. Start the game and walk to the trigger object that has a trigger and an object should be instantiated.
