Creating a health bar in Unity:
1. Add an image to the hierarchy.
2.Drag the image to the centre.
4.Add the border of the bar(sprite).
5.Add an empty GameObject and change its name to "Health Bar".
6. Pair the border to the "Health Bar" game object.
7.Add another image and name it "Fill". 
8.Scale the fill image to the border of the health bar.
9.Add a slider component to the "Health Bar" object and set everything to none.
10.Drag the fill image to the "fill rect" function of the slider.
11.Add a "Health bar" script to the "Healthbar" object.
12.Add this code to the "Health bar" script:

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class Healthbar : MonoBehaviour
{

    public Slider slider;
    public Gradient gradient;
    public Image fill;
    public void SetMaxHealth(int health)
    {
        slider.maxValue = health;
        slider.value = health;

       fill.color = gradient.Evaluate(1f);
    }
    public void SetHealth(int health)
    {

        slider.value = health;

        fill.color = gradient.Evaluate(slider.normalizedValue);

    }
  

}

This code will set the health to max when the level starts. It also creates a public variable for the slider.

//13. If you are going to use the script in a "player takes damage" game, add a player object and add a "Player" script:
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int maxHealth = 100;
    public int currentHealth;

    public Healthbar healthBar;
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        currentHealth = maxHealth;
        healthBar.SetMaxHealth(maxHealth);
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            TakeDamage(20);
        }
    }

    void TakeDamage(int damage)
    {
        currentHealth -= damage;
        healthBar.SetHealth(currentHealth);
    }
}

This code will help with setting the health of the player to the max when the level starts and make it when you press "Space", the player takes damage.
14. If you want to add gradient to the health bar (make it so when the health is reduced, the color of the health bar changes.)
